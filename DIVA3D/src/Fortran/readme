To compile the code you have two main possibilities:

1. Work with the specific script:

    a) edit the file 'divacompile_options' according to your installation
    b) run the script 'divacompileall'

2. Use the Makefile

    a) edit the file 'Makefile'
    b) type 'make' or 'make all'


In both cases you need to have the netCDF library installed.
Following the procedures from
